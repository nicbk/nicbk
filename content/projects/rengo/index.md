# Go for more than two players
Rengo is a version of Go that can be played with four players.
In this rendition of Rengo, any number of players can join a room
to play together.

# Rules
The rules are the same as in regular Go.
There are two teams: white and black. 
Players will be alternately assigned to teams as they join.
A player can quit the game at any time. 
However, there is also a `pass` button to simulate passing in other
Go variations, whereby a player can skip their turn.
If all players skip their turn in order, then the game ends.
A player who has just passed is denoted with their row filled red.
