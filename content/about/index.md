      I am an incoming masters student at Stanford.
      I am finishing up my undergraduate computer science degree summa cum laude at UC Davis.
      My career goals are broadly as follows: to contribute to the fields of
      mathematics and physics with a focus on artificial intelligence, and
      to engineer ethical and impactful creations that are preferably free
      and open source.
